Problem 1:

In the init function, create an array of friends.

  String[] friends={"","","","",};

Problem 2:

Write a function convert that accepts an array of temperatures in celsius and converts each temperature to farhenheit and returns a new array with the convert temperatures.

Use the CelsiusToFarhenheit function given to you.

NOTE: to test this function, create an array temperatues in celsius which you will pass to test your new function.




  double celsiusToFarhenheit(double c){
        return c*9/5+32;
  }
